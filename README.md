# Zoc'Neirs Vengeance AKA Zolanore
My second semi-serious Game. A Challenging Open-World, Fantasy, RPG game. Art inspired by Genshin Impact &amp; Zelda BOTW. Combat inspired by Trove, New world, &amp; DS. Zoc'Nier is the old prototype name for the game, the new name is Zolanore.

This is a portfolio project/school project mainly but I have been wanting to try to create a RPG game for quite a while now. Development of this game isnt going to be very long just 2 - 4 months and I will publish it on itch or some public platform.
